# AUTODOC_FLASK
A flask app used to upload templates(admin) and use the template by populating it (employees)

set env variables to terminal to run flask
then run flask

yet to establish a database
so hypothetically 2 users, admin and user
admin uploads templates
user choses the uploaded template and gives input to the parsed variables in the template, then generates the new file.
